# PouchDB Definitions Usage Notes

## Referencing PouchDB definition files in your code

To do that, simply add `/// <reference path="pouchdb.d.ts" />` at the top of your code.

To reference a specific version, include the reference number, like so: `/// <reference path="pouchdb-1.0.1.d.ts" />`.

That will make available to your code all interfaces PouchDB' main module implements.
